    "#Therotical questions\n",
    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" that contain data and methods. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and organization. Core principles include encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have. Classes encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods). Objects interact with one another in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features. Encapsulation hides internal state by restricting direct access to data using access modifiers. Both improve code security and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, and __repr__ are special methods used to define object behavior. They enable operator overloading and built-in Python functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent). It promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy. Python supports single and multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The same method name can behave differently across classes. It supports flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "Encapsulation is achieved using private (_var, __var) and public variables and methods. Access is controlled via getter/setter methods or property decorators. This protects data from unintended access.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "A constructor is the __init__ method, automatically called when a class instance is created. It initializes the object’s attributes. It can accept parameters for customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "Class methods use @classmethod and receive the class as cls. Static methods use @staticmethod and don’t access class or instance data. Both are called on the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "Python does not support true method overloading. Instead, you can use default arguments or *args and **kwargs to simulate it. Only the last defined method with the same name is retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. It supports polymorphism and dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "The @property decorator is used to define getter methods. It allows accessing methods like attributes and is often used with setters (@<property>.setter) to manage attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "Polymorphism improves flexibility and scalability by allowing the same interface to handle different data types or classes. It supports clean, maintainable, and extensible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "An abstract class is defined using the abc module and contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. It provides a common interface for related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "OOP improves code reuse through inheritance, makes code more modular and organized, and enhances maintainability. It mirrors real-world entities for better modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "Class variables are shared across all instances of a class. Instance variables are unique to each object. Modifying a class variable affects all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. Python uses the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine which method to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python\n",
    "__str__ returns a user-friendly string for the object, used by print(). __repr__ returns an official string, used for debugging. Prefer __repr__ for unambiguous representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
    "super() calls a method from the parent class. It’s commonly used in constructors to initialize the parent class. Helps maintain method resolution order in inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "__del__ is the destructor method called when an object is deleted. It’s used to free resources, though relying on it is discouraged due to Python's garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "@staticmethod doesn’t take self or cls and can't access class/instance data. @classmethod takes cls and can access class variables/methods. Both are used without creating an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "With inheritance, child classes override parent methods. Python calls the overridden method depending on the object’s actual type, enabling different behaviors for the same method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line. Each method returns self, allowing the next method to be called on the same instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "The __call__ method lets an object be called like a function. It allows instances to behave like callable functions with custom behavior."
